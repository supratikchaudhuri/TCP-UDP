### Key learnings from this project

1. **Socket Programming:** Working with UDP and TCP involves socket programming. I learnt how to create client and server sockets, establish communication channels, and handle data transfer using UDP and TCP.

2. **Client-Server Architecture:** Understanding the basics of client-server architecture was essential for this project. I learnt how to design the client and server components to enable communication and exchange data effectively.

3. **Request-Response Communication:** Implementing GET, PUT, and DELETE involved request-response communication patterns. Hence, I gained experience in structuring requests, handling them on the server side, and returning appropriate responses to the client.

4. **Protocol Design:** Designed a protocol for communication between the client and server is crucial and define the structure and format of the requests and responses, including the necessary metadata and payload.

5. **File I/O Operations:** Worked with file input/output operations in Java to store the key-value pairs in a .properties file on the server side. This involved reading the file, modifying its contents, and updating it based on the client's requests.

6. **Error Handling and Resilience:** Dealing with various scenarios, such as handling invalid requests, network errors, and unexpected server or client behaviors, taught me how to handle errors gracefully and build resilience into your application.

7. **Testing and Debugging:** As with any software development project, testing and debugging play crucial roles. Learned how to write unit tests, perform integration testing, and debug issues that may arise during development.

8. **Documentation and Code Organization:** Properly documented my code and organizing the project structure will improve readability and maintainability.
