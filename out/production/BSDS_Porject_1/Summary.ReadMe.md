### Key learnings: 

1. **Socket Programming:** Working with UDP and TCP involves socket programming. I learnt how to create client and server sockets, establish communication channels, and handle data transfer using UDP and TCP packets.

2. **Client-Server Architecture:** I got a hands-on experience in developing the basics of client-server architecture and how to design the client and server components to enable communication and exchange data effectively.

3. **Request-Response Communication:** Implementing GET, PUT, and DELETE requests involved request-response communication patterns. I gained experience in structuring requests, handling them on the server side, and returning appropriate responses to the client.

4. **Protocol Design:** Designed a user-friendly protocol for communication between the client and server was crucial for this project. I needed to define the structure and format of the requests and responses, including the necessary metadata and payload.

5. **File I/O Operations:** I worked with file input/output operations in Java to store the key-value pairs in a .properties file through the server side. This involved reading the file, modifying its contents, and updating it based on the client's requests.

6. **Error Handling and Resilience:** Dealing with various scenarios, such as handling invalid requests, network errors, and unexpected server or client behaviors, taught me how to handle errors gracefully and build resilience into the application.

7. **Testing and Debugging:** As with any software development project, testing and debugging play crucial roles. I learnt how to write unit tests, perform integration testing, and debug issues that may arise during development.

8. **Documentation and Code Organization:** Properly documenting the code and organizing the project structure improved readability, and maintainability. I also practiced writing clear documentation and adhere to best practices for code organization.

By working on this project, I gained practical experience in network programming, file I/O, protocol design, error handling, and other essential aspects of building distributed systems using Java. These skills are valuable for developing various types of networked applications and can be applied in future projects involving client-server interactions.
